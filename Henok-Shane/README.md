# UXE - Build A JavaScript Thing

## Overview
- This web application shows various AFI-rated top movies
- Added an email and password field for a mock sign-in. We used JavaScript to verify that both fields were filled in. We also include a limit of 3 attempts to enter in info into the new fields.

## Issues
- Henok and I both are still fairly weak with our JavaScript skills. This led to ensuring that we both had to work together to test our code step by step. Both of us were able to spot an error in the code as we continued to code. This was very helpful for both of us to gain more experiance and understanding.



#### Collaborators
This JavaScript Thing was coded and designed by Shane and Henok
